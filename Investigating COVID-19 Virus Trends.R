"""
Overview:

In this beginner-level R project, you'll step into the role of
a data analyst exploring the global COVID-19 pandemic
using real-world data. Leveraging R and the powerful dplyr library,
you'll manipulate, filter, and aggregate a comprehensive dataset
containing information on COVID-19 cases, tests, and hospitalizations 
across different countries. By applying data wrangling techniques such 
as grouping and summarizing,
you'll uncover which countries have the highest rates
of positive COVID-19 tests relative to their testing numbers.
This hands-on project will not only strengthen
your R programming skills and analytical thinking
but also provide valuable experience in deriving actionable insights
from real-world health data â€“ a crucial skill in today'
s data-driven healthcare landscape.
